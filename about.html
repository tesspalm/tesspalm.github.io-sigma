          <br><br><h2>Brief History</h2>
                <h4>International Society</h4>
                <span>Sigma Tau Delta, International English Honor Society, was founded in 1924 at Dakota Wesleyan University, to confer distinction for high achievement in English language, literature, and writing; and to foster literacy and all aspects of the discipline of English. With over 850 chapters in large and small, public and private, colleges and universities in the U.S. and abroad, Sigma Tau Delta is the most active honors organization in our field and one of the largest members of the Association of College Honor Societies. <br><br>

                In addition to the prestige of membership in an international honor society, there are many other benefits of affiliation: thousands of dollars in scholarship and award opportunities, regional and national conferences, and internship and publication possibilities. One especially noteworthy benefit of membership is that students are invited to submit papers for presentation at Sigma Tau Delta’s annual spring convention, held each year in one of the Society’s six regions of the country. Students selected to present their work in this national venue also have the opportunity to win convention writing awards and to attend presentations and workshops by nationally recognized authors such as Neil Gaiman, Ursula Le Guin, and U.S. Poet Laureates Natasha Trethewey and Kay Ryan. In summary, Sigma Tau Delta is about recognition and opportunity, and is dedicated to making a real difference in the life of each and every Sigma Tau Deltan. <br><br>
                    
                    <h4>Alpha Phi Psi</h4>
                Our local chapter at UNC Chapel Hill, the Alpha Phi Psi Chapter of Sigma Tau Delta, was founded in Spring 2016. Our chapter's central purpose is to confer distinction for high achievement in English language, literature, and writing to Carolina students regardless of their major. The organization is dedicated to fostering literacy and all aspects of the discipline of English. The Society's UNC chapter offers its Carolina members thousands of dollars in scholarships, internships, grants, and awards, as well as publication opportunities in its journals The Rectangle and The Sigma Tau Delta Review. At the annual international convention, Carolina selects and sends a few students who along with over 1,000 other students and faculty participate in scholarly and creative paper presentations, workshops, and roundtables, and hear featured speakers such as Ursula K. Le Guin, Neil Gaiman, and Poets Laureate Kay Ryan and Natasha Trethewey. As a blooming chapter at UNC, we strive to achieve the founding principles of this organization, and continue to foster high achievement in the discipline of English at UNC-Chapel Hill. <br><br>
